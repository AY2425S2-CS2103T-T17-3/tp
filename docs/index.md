**Tutorly is a desktop application designed specifically for private tutors.** It empowers tutors to quickly track student records, log lesson details, record attendance, and generate progress reports - all through fast, keyboard-driven interactions. While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using Tutorly, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing Tutorly, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
